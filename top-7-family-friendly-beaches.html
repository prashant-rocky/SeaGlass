        <h2 class="sub-title mt-4">3. Zushi Beach</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
            Zushi Beach offers a quieter alternative for families who prefer less crowded areas. The water is relatively
            shallow near the shore, making it suitable for children. Bicycle rentals and walking paths along the
            coastline provide additional activities for families. Local cafés and small eateries are available nearby,
            offering simple meals and refreshments throughout the day.
        </p>

            beach features soft sand and gentle waves, ideal for swimming and playing in the sand. While slightly
            smaller than other Shonan beaches, it offers a peaceful environment for families looking to escape larger
            crowds. Public restrooms and seasonal rental services are available to enhance convenience.
        </p>

            it easy to grab snacks or enjoy a relaxed meal without leaving the area.
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-title mt-4">6. Isshiki Beach</h2>
        <p class="article-text">

        <h2 class="sub-title mt-4">Tips for Visiting Shonan Coast Beaches</h2>
        <p class="article-text">
            When planning a family beach trip along the Shonan Coast, consider visiting early in the day to secure
            parking and quieter spots. Bring essentials such as sunscreen, hats, towels, and water. Many beaches offer
            seasonal rentals for umbrellas, beach chairs, and water sports gear. Check local ferry or train schedules if
            you plan to visit multiple beaches in one day to optimize your travel time.
